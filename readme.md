# PyMonitr, a simple system monitor for your linux computer!!
### **But why PyMonitr??**
### **Because with PyMonitr you can:**
1. **Monitor your RAM, CPU, storage ('/') & swap usage,**
2. **AND information about your CPU, such as:**
+ **Usage,**

+ **Total logical & non logical cores,**
+ **Architecture type,**
+ **CPU vendor &**

# Any screenshots??:
### **Sure**
![screenshot 1](img.png)

# Requirements
### **[psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) and [colorhex](https://pypi.org/project/colorhex/) are required**
### **install using:**
+ **pip3 install psutil colorhex**

# How to use
### **Make sure you have installed the requirements (or you can just ignore this step, and let the program itself install the requirements), and then either git clone the repo, or click the green download button and click download as zip. After that youll see some files (pymn_v1, v2, v3 etc). You can run them by opening the terminal on the folder, and doing "python3 pymn_v?.py" (make sure youre using python3.6+!!). The current LATEST version is 8.3, so i suggest you to use 8.3!**

# Oh, and...
### **You can control the "update interval (or whatever its called)", how many seconds should the progrm wait to refresh the information. By default, its 1 second. You can change it by using the "r flag". Example:**
+ **python3 pymn_v8.3.py -r 2 for 2 seconds, -r 3 for 3 sconds etc**

# Changelog??
### **If you want to see whats new or what have i changed on all these versions, you can check the changelog.md file!!**

# NOTE!
### **The program sadly CANNOT display the CPU temperature if youre using a AMD CPU. Im currently trying to fix this. If you know any way to fix this, you can open a issue**

# Which file should i use?
### **Now there are a lot of files/different versions, but i suggest you to use the latest, which is 8.3!**

# ***...***
### **I know, the code looks pretty bad, and there could be a lot of ways to make it better, but IM NOT experienced, ***so please dont make fun of me!!*** What you could do instead is helping & making this program better :)**
